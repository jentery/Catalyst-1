The main idea I walked away from this morning's brainstorming session with was photographing a scale model that is in motion.  By creating a 3D model out of an image compilation based around an object in flux, various moments of time would be compiled into one combined instant; smashing a four dimensional existence back into three.  One specific idea I had in this regard was to build blocks in the shop, drape cloth over them and make it ripple with a fan.  By photographin this numerous times the underlying shape or colors could serve as an anchor while the algorithms attempted to sew differing pixels together as best it could.

Another idea which I considered pursuing was the creation of a facade that spatially responded to the nearness of neighboring objects.  It would come forward to meet nearby objects while receding inward in response to open spaces.

After discussing our ideas, a lecture and lunch, our group met back up and learned to use Git.  Git is a programming interface which will enable us to effectively manage our images and information while working with large datasets.  In addition to Git we learned how to use the very simple text format of Markdown.  I downloaded Sublime text to work in this format.  While it wasn't necessarily required, Sublime has a high quality coding interface which I am so far quite satisfied with.

Above is a random facade from Google, proof to myself that I know how to insert a link in a document.  Wooooo!
