# Catalyst Workshop

##Monday March 9, 2015

The main idea I walked away from this morning's brainstorming session with was photographing a scale model that is in motion.  By creating a 3D model out of an image compilation based around an object in flux, various moments of time would be compiled into one combined instant; smashing a four dimensional existence back into three.  

Another idea which I was somewhat pleased with was the creation of a facade that spatially responded to the nearness of neighboring objects.  It would come forward to meet nearby objects while receding inward in response to open spaces.
